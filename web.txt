1 Scrape an online E-Commerce Site for Data.
1. Extract product data from Amazon - be it any product and
put these details in the MySQL database. One can use
pipeline. Like 1 pipeline to process the scraped data and
other to put data in the databaseand since Amazon has
some restrictions on scraping of data, ask them to work on
small set of requests otherwise proxies and all would have
to be used.
2. Scrape the details like color, dimensions, material etc. Or
customer ratings by features.

Create a small set of pages namely page1, page2, page3 and
page4 apply random walk on the same

You are everywhere dirt, on the floor, the windows, even on my shirt. And sometimes when i open my mouth, you are all that comes flowing out. I dream of my world without you, then half my chores are out too. A time of joy for me, lots of tv shows i.ll see. But i guess like all things you just must exist, like rain, hail and mist, and when my time here is done, you and i become one.
